# Lung-Disease-Classification-CNN

This notebook was a project done as part of my Caltech training. <br>
It includes:<br>
* Data preprocessing steps (loading data, descriptive stats, data augmentation)
* Training multiple CNN models
* Assessing performance of each (accuracy + loss between training/validation sets)
* Running each trained model on the test set

<br>
Enjoy!<br>
